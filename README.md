### Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data from the United States for the year 2023. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve road safety and reduce casualties. The analysis focuses on key factors contributing to road accidents, including accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and time of occurrence (day/night).

### Problem Statement
The objective is to analyze road accident data from 2023 to provide actionable insights through a dashboard. The focus is on understanding the patterns and severity of accidents, identifying high-risk areas, and highlighting trends over time to aid in better road safety planning and decision-making.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on road accidents in the United States. It includes data on accident severity, vehicle types involved, road conditions, time of occurrence (day/night), location details, and other critical factors. This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for uncovering patterns, identifying high-risk areas, and visualizing trends to enhance road safety insights.

### Tools

#### Excel
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Analysis
- Building Dashboard

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In this initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading and inspection
2. Handle missing or inconsistent data by removing or imputing values.
3. Standardize data formats (e.g., date and time fields).
4. Ensure proper categorization of variables (e.g., accident severity, road type, and vehicle type).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the road accident data to answer key question, such as:
- Total Casualties taken place after the accident.
- Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
- Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type.
- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year.
- Maximum casualties by Road Type.
- Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface.
- Relation between Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night.

### Conclusion
The road accident analysis for 2023 reveals a total of 85,601 casualties, with cars contributing the highest numbers and single carriageways identified as the most accident-prone road type. Most accidents occurred in urban areas and during daylight hours, with dry road conditions being the most common. Monthly trends remained consistent, with slight casualties making up the majority. Overall, the findings emphasize the need for targeted road safety measures focusing on high-risk road types, vehicle categories, and urban areas to reduce accidents and casualties effectively.

### Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Risk Road Types**: Implement stricter traffic regulations and improved signage on single carriageways, as these are associated with the highest number of casualties. Regular maintenance and safety audits should also be prioritized for these roads.  

2. **Enhance Urban Traffic Management**: Invest in advanced traffic control systems, such as smart traffic signals and monitoring cameras, to reduce accident rates in urban areas.  

3. **Promote Vehicle Safety**: Conduct awareness campaigns focusing on safe driving practices, especially for car and motorbike users, which contribute significantly to casualties.  

4. **Address Daylight Accidents**: Increase police patrolling and enforce speed limits during peak daylight hours when most accidents occur, and consider public awareness campaigns to reduce distracted driving.  

5. **Seasonal and Monthly Planning**: Use casualty trends to design targeted interventions during months with higher accident rates, such as increased public safety announcements and additional resources for traffic management during these periods.  

6. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Enhance road surface conditions and safety features such as reflective lane markings, guardrails, and lighting in accident-prone areas, even on dry roads where most incidents occur.  

7. **Leverage Data for Ongoing Analysis**: Continue using dashboards and data analytics to monitor real-time accident trends, allowing for adaptive and data-driven safety strategies.
